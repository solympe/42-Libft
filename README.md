# Libft - go to hell

Not interesting, just a practice

<b>Each</b> of this functions was written manually
The most part of functions were recreated from original functions. 
This task showed me how the library works in its own and how can i compile my own libraries

This is my project work on school21 in C language

Use command "make" to create library libft.a
Use command "make crear" to remove all .o files
Use command "make fclean" to remove all created files
Use command "make re" to rebuild the library
